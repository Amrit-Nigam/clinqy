        Rules: the list is in the order the facts were learned — later facts are newer and win when two disagree \
        (drop the older one as superseded). Merge facts that say the same thing into one line that keeps every detail \
        (names, numbers, emails, links, dates, app/chat names). Drop facts that are clearly one-off or no longer true \
        (an expired listing, a finished one-time task) as stale. Keep everything else exactly as written. \
        Never invent or change details. Keep each fact one short line. A fact may start with a scope tag like \
        [site:docs.google.com] or [app:Find My] (know-how for that place): keep the tag at the start, and merge only facts with the same tag.
